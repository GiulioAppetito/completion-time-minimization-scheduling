# Single Machine Scheduling with Release Dates

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and experimental evaluation of
algorithms for the **Single Machine Scheduling problem with Release Dates**
with the objective of minimizing the **sum of completion times**.

In standard scheduling notation, the problem is denoted as:

1 | rᵢ | ∑ Cᵢ

The project focuses on exact and approximate algorithmic approaches,
including a custom **Branch & Bound** method based on a **preemptive relaxation**
of the original problem.

## Problem Description
Given a set of jobs, each characterized by:
- a release date rᵢ
- a processing time pᵢ

the goal is to schedule all jobs on a single machine, without preemption,
so as to minimize the sum of their completion times.

This problem is known to be computationally challenging and is a classic
topic in scheduling theory and operations research.

## Algorithms Implemented

### Branch & Bound
A custom Branch & Bound algorithm is implemented, where:
- a **preemptive relaxation** of the problem is solved to obtain lower bounds
- branching decisions are based on whether the optimal solution at a node
  is preemptive or non-preemptive
- nodes yielding non-preemptive optimal schedules are fathomed

A time limit of **60 seconds per instance** is imposed.

---

### SRPT (Shortest Remaining Processing Time)
The **SRPT** rule is used to optimally solve the preemptive version of the
problem. This solution is exploited to:
- compute lower bounds
- guide the Branch & Bound search
- construct approximate non-preemptive schedules

---

### 2-Approximation Algorithm
A 2-approximation algorithm is implemented by converting an optimal
preemptive schedule into a non-preemptive one:

1. Jobs are ordered by increasing completion time in the preemptive schedule
2. Jobs are scheduled non-preemptively according to this order
3. Idle time is introduced whenever a job has not yet been released

This approach guarantees a solution whose objective value is at most
twice the optimal one.

---

## Experimental Evaluation
The algorithms are evaluated on a set of synthetic instances generated by
combining different distributions of:
- release dates (e.g., close to zero, far from zero, low variance, high variance, uniform)
- processing times (low variance, high variance, uniform)

Instances range from **2 to 30 jobs**.

The proposed Branch & Bound algorithm is compared against the commercial
solver **Gurobi**, with a maximum computation time of 60 seconds per instance.

Results show that the custom algorithm often achieves better execution times,
while Gurobi frequently finds optimal solutions but fails to certify
optimality within the given time limit.
